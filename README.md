PORTABLE SHULKERS
=
_Because I found all available options to be horrible._


A simple PaperMC plugin that allows opening shulkers without placing them down. Either right click in the air while holding a shulker of your choice (not targeting a block), or use /openshulker.

Note that this does use experimental APIs, so it may not work on versions not explicitly supported.

If you find any issues, please open an issue.
